Website from where to pull out the weather data:
https://openweathermap.org/

Go here: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api#how
Section: Current and forecast weather data

It will look something like this in code:
const api = `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat=${myLatitude}&lon=${myLongitude}&exclude=minutely&appid=9dd97c6cc827388076be21f1128cefef`

If the above code generates some error try something like this instead:
const proxi = `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`;
const api = `${proxi}https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat=${myLatitude}&lon=${myLongitude}&exclude=minutely&appid=9dd97c6cc827388076be21f1128cefef`


The degrees unit is by default in Kelvin so you can change it in the JS file using formulas
Or you can change the dafault to Celcius or Fahrenheit: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api#data go to UNITS of MEASUREMENT section!!!

I will do it in code! (i.e. not change current default degrees unit).

Weather Icons can be found here: https://github.com/maxdow/skycons
Details on how to use the icons: https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/

If you open skycons.js you will see they have names like PARTLY_CLOUDY_DAY,PARTLY_CLOUDY_NIGHT, CLOUDY, RAIN, etc. The problem is that the API website 
had different ICON names like 01d, 01n, 02d, 02n, 09d, etc so I will go change these in weather_app.js. I will look what all the codes (01d, 01n, 02d, 02n, 09d, etc)
mean and look into skycons.js and map them to the names in there. I will do it using an empty string in which I will concatenate skycons icon names, using a switch
to determine the exact names! Since skycons.js contained more names(categories) I just used the ones that I can map a possible code to it.
